\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Are [รง] and [x] allophones of the same phoneme? Why?}

		Yes, they are allophones as no words are distinguished by just these
		two sounds.

	\item{If yes, write a rule realizing that phoneme. If there are alternative
		formulations, write the simplest one.}

		/รง/ $\rightarrow$ [x] after back vowel
