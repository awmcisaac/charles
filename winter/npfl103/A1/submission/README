Make sure all requirements are installed:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python -c "import spacy_udpipe; spacy_udpipe.download('cs')"
  python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

To run experiments run the following commands, replacing train with test
where appropriate to obtain results for the test topics. The program must be
run from the parent directory of the documents.

```python
  python run.py -q topics-train_en.xml -d documents_en.lst -r run-0_en
    -o run-0_train_en.res

  python run.py -q topics-train_cs.xml -d documents_cs.lst -r run-0_cs
    -o run-0_train_cs.res

  python run.py -q topics-train_en.xml -d documents_en.lst -r run-1_en
    -o run-1_train_en.res --stopwords --lowercase --stemming
    --df-weighting prob_idf --pivoted 0.85

  python run.py -q topics-train_cs.xml -d documents_cs.lst -r run-1_cs
    -o run-1_train_cs.res --stopwords --lowercase --lemmas
    --df-weighting prob_idf --pivoted 0.9
```
The program will create an inverted index or load a saved one based on the
value of the -r parameter. That is, if the same run parameter has been called
before, there will be a saved index which does not need to be recreated, and
the queries can be run directly on that. Otherwise, it will construct a new one
before running the queries.
