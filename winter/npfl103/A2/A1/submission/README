Make sure all requirements are installed, including an active Elasticsearch
cluster. Docker is recommended, but alternative methods should also work, as
long as it is exposed at \texttt{localhost:9200}:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
docker network create elastic
docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.16.2
docker run --name es01-ir --net elastic
    -p 127.0.0.1:9200:9200 -p 127.0.0.1:9300:9300
    -e "discovery.type=single-node"
    docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.16.2
```

To run experiments run the following commands, replacing the LANGUAGE
and QUERIES environment variables where appropriate. The program must
be run from the parent directory of the documents.

```bash
export LANGUAGE="en"
export LANGUAGE="cs"
export QUERIES="train"
export QUERIES="test"
python run-0.py
python run-1.py
```
