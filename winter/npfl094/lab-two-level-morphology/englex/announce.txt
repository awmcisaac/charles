PC-KIMMO version 2
------------------

PC-KIMMO is a morphological parser based on Kimmo Koskenniemi's two-level
model of morphology.  It was first released by SIL (Summer Institute of
Linguistics) in 1990.  Version 2 (beta) is now available.  New features
include the following:

* The rules component supports multigraphs.

* The rules component can read a rules file produced by Xerox's TWOLC
  rule compiler.

* Lexical entries have a new, more flexible encoding format.

* Lexical entries permit a features field.

* A word grammar component has been added.

* The recognizer returns full parse trees and feature structures.

* A new Synthesis command produces surface forms from morphological forms
  (i.e. a sequence of morpheme glosses).

* A Windows version is available (command-line interface only, but uses
  Windows memory management).

Of these new features, the word grammar component is the most significant.
The word grammar component uses a unification-based parser based on the
PATR-II formalism described by Stuart M. Shieber in "An Introduction to
Unification- based Approaches to Grammar (CSLI, 1986).  The word grammar
produces output such as this tree and feature structure for the word
"enlargement":

         Word 
           |
         Stem 
      _____|______
    Stem      SUFFIX 
   ___|____    +ment 
PREFIX  Stem
  en+     |
        ROOT 
       `large 

Word:
[ head:  [ number:SG
           pos:   N ]
  lemma: `large
  lemma_pos:AJ ]


Note that the feature structure reports the part-of-speech (pos) of the word
(something not possible with PC-KIMMO version 1).  Thus one new use of
PC-KIMMO is part-of-speech tagging.

KTAGGER
-------

KTagger is a stand-alone application built with PC-KIMMO's basic parsing
functions.  It accepts as input a word list file, consisting of one word per
line, and produces as output a structured text file containing the
morphological parse(s) of each word.  The content and format of the output
file is determined by a "control" file constructed by the user.  KTagger can
be used to do part-of-speech tagging, produce a word lexicon, or other
structured output files.

KTagger runs on these systems: Unix, MS-DOS, Windows, and Macintosh.  It is a
batch-style program run by specifying command-line options.

To use KTagger, you need a PC-KIMMO language description such as Englex.  The
description must include a word grammar file.  You do not need PC-KIMMO itself
to use KTagger.

PC-KIMMO is a morphological parser based on Kimmo Koskenniemi's two-level
model of morphology.  It was first released by SIL (Summer Institute of
Linguistics) in 1990.  Version 2 (beta) is now available.


Examples of possible output formats
-----------------------------------

By using customized control files, you can use KTagger to produce output files
in a variety of formats.  Here are three examples of possible output file
formats.  (The control files themselves are described below.) These examples
use Englex as their language description.

Assume an input file such as this, consisting of one word per line:

time
flies

The first example, using the control file TDF.CTL, produces an output file in
tab-delimited format (where the white space is actually a tab character)
consisting of the input word and part-of-speech tag:

time    V
time    N
flies   N
flies   V

The second example, using the control file SFM.CTL, produces an output file in
"standard format" (backslash markers):

\w time
\lx `time
\pos V
\root `time
\root_pos V

\w time
\lx `time
\pos N
\root `time
\root_pos N

\w flies
\lx `fly+s
\pos N
\root `fly
\root_pos N

\w flies
\lx `fly+s
\pos V
\root `fly
\root_pos V

The third example, using the control file SGML.CTL, produces an output file in
SGML markup:

<lexicon>
<le><w>time</w><lx>`time</lx><pos>V</pos><root>`time</root><rootpos>V</rootp
os></le>
<le><w>time</w><lx>`time</lx><pos>N</pos><root>`time</root><rootpos>N</rootp
os></le>
<le><w>flies</w><lx>`fly+s</lx><pos>N</pos><root>`fly</root><rootpos>N</root
pos></le>
<le><w>flies</w><lx>`fly+s</lx><pos>V</pos><root>`fly</root><rootpos>V</root
pos></le>
</lexicon>

Englex -- a morphological description of English
------------------------------------------------

Englex was first released for PC-KIMMO version 1.  It has now been revised and
updated to work with PC-KIMMO version 2 (as well as PC-PATR--see below).  The
lexicon files have been converted to the new format, and a word grammar has
been added.

PC-PATR -- a syntactic parser
-----------------------------

PC-PATR is a syntactic parser that uses the same unification parser as
PC-KIMMO's word grammar component.  Thus the file format of a PC-PATR sentence
grammar is identical to a PC-KIMMO word grammar.  PC-PATR's user interface is
also very similar to PC-KIMMO.  PC-PATR actually has PC-KIMMO's morphological
parsing engine built into it.  This means that you can use a morphological
description such as Englex to provide lexical entries "on the fly" as you
parse a sentence.  The new entries provided by the morphological parser can
then be saved to a word lexicon file.  Here is a sample parse of the sentence
"the brave knights stormed cornwall":

                    S 
          __________|__________
         NP                  VP 
   _______|________       ____|_____
  Det   AdjP      N    VerbalP    NP 
   |      |    knights    |        |
  DT     AJ               V        N 
  the   brave          stormed cornwall 

S:
[ cat:   S
  pred:    [ cat:   VP
             head:    [ agr:   $1[ 3sg:   - ]
                        finite:+
                        pos:   V
                        tense: PAST
                        vform: ED ] ]
  subj:    [ cat:   NP
             head:    [ agr:   $1
                        case:  NOM
                        number:PL
                        pos:   N
                        proper:-
                        verbal:- ] ] ]


Please note that only a _TOY_ grammar of English has been included with
PC-PATR!  It is intended only to demonstrate how to write a grammar and also
how to interface PC-PATR with a morphological description (namely Englex).

PC-PATR is presently designated as an alpha release.  This is not because it
is buggy or unstable, but because it still lacks features that we intend to
add.

PC-PARSE -- a mailing list for SIL parsing software
---------------------------------------------------

We have a mailing list to facilitate user support for SIL's parsing software,
presently PC-PATR, PC-KIMMO, and AMPLE (another morphological parser which
eventually will also be embedded in PC-PATR).  The list is called PC-PARSE.
Users of the software are encouraged to use the list to ask questions, offer
tips and solutions to problems, and exchange data and descriptions.  To
subscribe to the list, create a message consisting of this line only:

  SUBSCRIBE PC-PARSE

and send it to this Internet e-mail address:
